# Resources to learn the CRuby interals

This is a list of resources that I have been gathering so far
to learn about the CRuby internals.

## Resources

### Ruby Hack Challege

Ruby Hack Challenge is a repository on Github created by Ko1 (Koichi Sasada). In this repo,
there are resources and documentation about CRuby development.

### Peter Zhu Personal Blob

In his blog, Peter Zhu shares a lot of information about CRuby internals. You can
find info about the CRuby GC, a guide about the CRuby code base, and more.

## Kevin Newton Personal Blog

In his blog, Kevin Newton shares a lot of information about CRuby internals. You can
find info about Prism, the new Ruby parser, a series about YARV (the CRuby VM), and
a lot more.
